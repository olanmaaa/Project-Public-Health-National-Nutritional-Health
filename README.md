Public Health R Project: NHANES Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the NHANES dataset from the CDC to explore health and nutritional status indicators in a representative US population sample. It focuses on variables such as BMI, age, weight, pulse, blood pressure, diabetes, smoking status, and alcohol use.

## Motivation
The analysis aims to uncover health trends, demographic correlations, and behavioral patterns that can inform public health policy and intervention design.

## Dataset
- Source: NHANES dataset via Hackbio
- Size: 5000 observations, 32 variables (including demographics and health metrics)
- Missing data handled by replacing with zeroes during preprocessing

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing in R
- Visualization using histograms and scatterplots (base R and ggplot2)
- Statistical analysis including mean, range, variance, standard deviation, and t-tests
- Exploratory data analysis focused on relationships between health indicators and demographics

## Results
- BMI distribution suggests a prevalence of overweight/obesity
- Significant differences in BMI by diabetes status and alcohol use by relationship status
- Visualizations reveal complex interactions among weight, height, gender, diabetes, and smoking
